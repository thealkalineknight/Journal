#Privated for now

This is a demo game I worked on a year ago. It still gets some updates for fun.
It is a raycaster with some addtional features like rotating sprites, 
complex enemy intellegence varying with NPC type, locked doors, secrets, weapons, pickups, 
a UI, and a level 2 that is accessible but it takes longer for me to do art than program.
I will eventually make it public once I do a bit more and my music producer is alright with it.
